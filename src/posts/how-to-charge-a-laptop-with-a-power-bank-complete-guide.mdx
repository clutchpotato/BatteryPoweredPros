## Why Power Bank is the Best charger for your Laptop?

You can consider it as the best portable battery for your Laptop that you can get easily. The most fantastic thing about a power bank is that it doesn’t ask you to plug it into an outlet while charging your Laptop effectively. All you have to do is connect your Laptop with a power bank and get your desired process done.

### What Power Bank is best for Charging Laptops?

If you think that all power banks can support charging your Laptop, we are sorry to say that you are wrong: all power banks are not the same, and not each one has the same charging capacity.

There are many types/modes of laptops that you can use for charging. Some of them are as follows:

![powerbank types](/img/types-of-power-banks.jpg)

1. **USB Type-A Power Bank:** If you know that your Laptop is less-powerful, you can use this USB Type-A power bank with enough power to generate, and this can quickly charge your Laptop.
2. **USB Type-C Power Bank:** when your Laptop is more potent, like any mobile workstation, then you can use this Type-C power bank to charge it. This Type-C power bank is powerful enough to power your other USB devices like tablets or smartphones.

#### How often can you use a power bank with a single charge?

Most likely, a power bank is capable of charging up your Laptop only one or two times with its single charge life. You can quickly charge your high-power laptop with it whenever you want.

However, this is to note that you would not be able to charge up your Laptop if your power bank runs out of charge. It would be best if you plugged it into an outlet to help it gain power once again.

So, charging with a power bank can save your time and travel mood that you took with you while you started your journey.
